# Faculty Feedback System

This is my incubator project that I created to help trainees post questions and get answers from anyone. Trainees can also give ratings to faculty members without revealing their identity (anonymous feedback).

## About the Project

This platform lets trainees:
- Ask questions on a forum that anyone can answer
- Give anonymous ratings and feedback to faculty members
- See a list of faculty members and their subjects
- View recent questions from other trainees

## Pages in the App

1. **Login Page** - Where users enter username and password to get into the system
2. **Dashboard** - Shows faculty list and recent questions asked by trainees
3. **Feedback Page** - Where trainees can rate faculty members without showing their name
4. **Query Forum** - A place where trainees can ask questions and others can reply

## Tools I Used

- React - For building the website
- Tailwind CSS - For making it look nice without writing too much CSS
- React-Toastify - For showing those pop-up messages when something happens
- JSONPlaceholder - As a fake API since I don't have a real backend yet
- LocalStorage - To save data like feedback and questions directly in the browser

## How to Run

1. Download the code
2. Run `npm install` to get all the packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the website
4. Login with username: `adi`, `sai` or `shweta` and password: `test`

## What I Want to Add Later

- Maybe add a way for faculty to see their feedback
- Make it look better on mobile phones
- Add more features as I learn more

This is my first project, so there might be some bugs but it works for what I needed!
